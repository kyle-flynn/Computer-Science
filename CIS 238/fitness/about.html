      <h1>Common Exercises</h1>
      <p>The following are common exercises that we encourage our clients to do as part of their daily exercise routine.</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Burpee</dt>
        <dd>
          Burpees are a great, full body exercise to increase your strength and endurance. Begin in a standing position, drop into a squat and extend your hands forward, kick your feet back and then forward again quickly, and then jump up from a squatted position.<br>
          <button onclick="burpees()">See example</button>
        </dd>

        <dt>Plank</dt>
        <dd>
          Planks build your core strength. To perform a plank, get in a push up position and rest your forearms on the floor. Hold the position as long as you can.<br>
          <button onclick="plank()">See example</button>
        </dd>

        <dt>Mountain Climber</dt>
        <dd>
          Mountain climbers are a good cardio exercise. Place your hands on the floor in a push up position, then bring one knee up to your chest and then switch as quickly as you can (as though you are climbing a mountain).<br>
          <button onclick="mtnClimber()">See example</button>
        </dd>
      </dl>
