        <h3>Survivor Stories</h3>
        <p>Seeing the parade of motorcycles from all over the United States was super exciting.
            They brought pins and patches from all over the United States and put them on a sash to decorate my wheelchair.
        <p>After so many days of pain and boredom, seeing the Cycle Out Cancer riders was a real thrill!  ~ Jennifer</p>

        <p>I spent 10 days in the hospital just crying.  The Cycle Out Cancer guys were so colorful
            and generous.  They gave the hospital a very generous donation in my name and showed me
            that even strangers care about me. ~ Kristen</p>

        <p>I had the good fortune to meet several Cycle Out Cancer guys. Everyone has been touched
            by cancer.  They are out there doing something about it. ~ Fritz</p>

        <p>As soon as my treatments are over, I'm getting a Spyder motorcycle to ride with Cycle Out Cancer.
            Can't wait! ~ Scott</p>
