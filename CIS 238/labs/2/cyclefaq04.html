        <p>Cancer is a common name for diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells.</p>
        <p class="boldtext">How does cancer start?</p>
        <p>The specific reasons cancer starts vary greatly from individual to individual as well as between the different types of cancers.  However, scientific studies have proven that several factors are known to trigger or accelerate cancer such as extensive use of tobacco or alcohol, inappropriate exposure to radiation or to toxic substances such as asbestos, and even certain viruses. </p>
        <p class="boldtext">Is cancer a contagious disease?</p>
        <p>Studies have not shown cancer to be contagious although certain cancers do seem to run in families such as breast cancer.</p>
        <p class="boldtext">Is it possible to prevent cancer?</p>
        <p>While there are no certain ways to prevent cancer, studies have proven that people with healthy diets and lifestyles are less likely to get cancer than those do not.</p>
        <p class="boldtext">What are the early warning signs of cancer?</p>
