        <h3>Monthly Rides</h3>
        <h4>First Friday of the Month - May - June - July - Aug - September</h4>
        <p>The first Friday of these months we honor past members who have had cancer but are no longer with us. Our route may include a lunch at their favorite watering hole, a visit to their surviving spouse, or a visit to the cemetary to decorate their grave.  Contact <a href="mailto:cycleoutcancer@cycleoutcancer.com">Cycle Out Cancer</a> for more information on commemorative rides in your area.</p>
        <h3>Rider Safety</h3>
        <p>All riders must adhere to basic safety rules while on our rides:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Gear up:  Wear an approved helmet and protective clothing appropriate for the weather.</li>
            <li>Maintain the big stuff: Check your tires, breaks, fluids, electronics, and frame before each ride.</li>
            <li>Check the little stuff: Make sure your lights, blinkers, mirrors, and stands all work correctly.</li>
            <li>Obey all traffic laws, lights, and signs.</li>
            <li>Drive defensively and respectfully even when others do not.</li>
        </ol>
