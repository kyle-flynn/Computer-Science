******This file should be named rndsf10.txt or rndsf10.zip******

Corrected EDITIONS of our etexts get a new NUMBER, rndsf11.txt
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, rndsf10a.txt


This etext was scanned by David Price, email ccx074@coventry.ac.uk,
from the 1896 Smith, Elder and Co. "Lizzie Leigh and Other Tales"
edition.  Proofing by Vanessa Mosher, Jennifer Lee, Alev Akman and
Andy Wallace.

Project Gutenberg Etexts are usually created from multiple editions,
all of which are in the Public Domain in the United States, unless a
copyright notice is included.  Therefore, we usually do NOT keep any
of these books in compliance with any particular paper edition.


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.

Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-six text
files per month, or 432 more Etexts in 1999 for a total of 2000+
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach over 200 billion Etexts given away this year.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only ~5% of the present number of computer users.

At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 3,333 Etexts unless we
manage to get some real funding; currently our funding is mostly
from Michael Hart's salary at Carnegie-Mellon University, and an
assortment of sporadic gifts; this salary is only good for a few
more years, so we are looking for something to replace it, as we
don't want Project Gutenberg to be so dependent on one person.

We need your donations more than ever!

ROUND THE SOFA.




[Project Gutenberg note:  Elizabeth Gaskell wrote the following story
to join together a number of her other, previously published, short
stories.  Project Gutenberg has already released the other stories
and so they are not repeated here--however, notes are given at the
appropriate places.--DP.]

Long ago I was placed by my parents under the medical treatment of a
certain Mr. Dawson, a surgeon in Edinburgh, who had obtained a
reputation for the cure of a particular class of diseases.  I was
sent with my governess into lodgings near his house, in the Old Town.
I was to combine lessons from the excellent Edinburgh masters, with
the medicines and exercises needed for my indisposition.  It was at
first rather dreary to leave my brothers and sisters, and to give up
our merry out-of-doors life with our country home, for dull lodgings,
with only poor grave Miss Duncan for a companion; and to exchange our
romps in the garden and rambles through the fields for stiff walks in
the streets, the decorum of which obliged me to tie my bonnet-strings
neatly, and put on my shawl with some regard to straightness.

The evenings were the worst.  It was autumn, and of course they daily
grew longer:  they were long enough, I am sure, when we first settled
down in those gray and drab lodgings.  For, you must know, my father
and mother were not rich, and there were a great many of us, and the
medical expenses to be incurred by my being placed under Mr. Dawson's
care were expected to be considerable; therefore, one great point in
our search after lodgings was economy.  My father, who was too true a
gentleman to feel false shame, had named this necessity for cheapness
to Mr. Dawson; and in return, Mr. Dawson had told him of those at No.
6 Cromer Street, in which we were finally settled.  The house
belonged to an old man, at one time a tutor to young men preparing
for the University, in which capacity he had become known to Mr.
Dawson.  But his pupils had dropped off; and when we went to lodge
with him, I imagine that his principal support was derived from a few
occasional lessons which he gave, and from letting the rooms that we
took, a drawing-room opening into a bed-room, out of which a smaller
chamber led.  His daughter was his housekeeper:  a son, whom we never
saw, supposed to be leading the same life that his father had done
before him, only we never saw or heard of any pupils; and there was
one hard-working, honest little Scottish maiden, square, stumpy,
neat, and plain, who might have been any age from eighteen to forty.

Looking back on the household now, there was perhaps much to admire
in their quiet endurance of decent poverty; but at this time, their
poverty grated against many of my tastes, for I could not recognize
the fact, that in a town the simple graces of fresh flowers, clean
white muslin curtains, pretty bright chintzes, all cost money, which
is saved by the adoption of dust-coloured moreen, and mud-coloured
carpets.  There was not a penny spent on mere elegance in that room;
yet there was everything considered necessary to comfort:  but after
all, such mere pretences of comfort! a hard, slippery, black horse-
hair sofa, which was no place of rest; an old piano, serving as a
sideboard; a grate, narrowed by an inner supplement, till it hardly
held a handful of the small coal which could scarcely ever be stirred
up into a genial blaze.  But there were two evils worse than even
this coldness and bareness of the rooms:  one was that we were
provided with a latch-key, which allowed us to open the front door
whenever we came home from a walk, and go upstairs without meeting
any face of welcome, or hearing the sound of a human voice in the
apparently deserted house--Mr. Mackenzie piqued himself on the
noiselessness of his establishment; and the other, which might almost
seem to neutralize the first, was the danger we were always exposed
to on going out, of the old man--sly, miserly, and intelligent--
popping out upon us from his room, close to the left hand of the
door, with some civility which we learned to distrust as a mere
pretext for extorting more money, yet which it was difficult to
refuse:  such as the offer of any books out of his library, a great
temptation, for we could see into the shelf-lined room; but just as
we were on the point of yielding, there was a hint of the
"consideration" to be expected for the loan of books of so much
higher a class than any to be obtained at the circulating library,
which made us suddenly draw back.  Another time he came out of his
den to offer us written cards, to distribute among our acquaintance,
on which he undertook to teach the very things I was to learn; but I
would rather have been the most ignorant woman that ever lived than
tried to learn anything from that old fox in breeches.  When we had
declined all his proposals, he went apparently into dudgeon.  Once
when we had forgotten our latch-key we rang in vain for many times at
the door, seeing our landlord standing all the time at the window to
the right, looking out of it in an absent and philosophical state of
mind, from which no signs and gestures of ours could arouse him.

The women of the household were far better, and more really
respectable, though even on them poverty had laid her heavy left
hand, instead of her blessing right.  Miss Mackenzie kept us as short
in our food as she decently could--we paid so much a week for our
board, be it observed; and if one day we had less appetite than
another our meals were docked to the smaller standard, until Miss
Duncan ventured to remonstrate.  The sturdy maid-of-all-work was
scrupulously honest, but looked discontented, and scarcely vouchsafed
us thanks, when on leaving we gave her what Mrs. Dawson had told us
would be considered handsome in most lodgings.  I do not believe
Phenice ever received wages from the Mackenzies.

But that dear Mrs. Dawson!  The mention of her comes into my mind
like the bright sunshine into our dingy little drawing room came on
those days;--as a sweet scent of violets greets the sorrowful passer
among the woodlands.

Mrs. Dawson was not Mr. Dawson's wife, for he was a bachelor.  She
was his crippled sister, an old maid, who had, what she called, taken
her brevet rank.

After we had been about a fortnight in Edinburgh, Mr. Dawson said, in
a sort of half doubtful manner to Miss Duncan -

"My sister bids me say, that every Monday evening a few friends come
in to sit round her sofa for an hour or so,--some before going to
gayer parties--and that if you and Miss Greatorex would like a little
change, she would only be too glad to see you.  Any time from seven
to eight to-night; and I must add my injunctions, both for her sake,
and for that of my little patient's, here, that you leave at nine
o'clock.  After all, I do not know if you will care to come; but
Margaret bade me ask you;" and he glanced up suspiciously and sharply
at us.  If either of us had felt the slightest reluctance, however
well disguised by manner, to accept this invitation, I am sure he
would have at once detected our feelings, and withdrawn it; so
jealous and chary was he of anything pertaining to the appreciation
of this beloved sister.

But if it had been to spend an evening at the dentist's, I believe I
should have welcomed the invitation, so weary was I of the monotony
of the nights in our lodgings; and as for Miss Duncan, an invitation
to tea was of itself a pure and unmixed honour, and one to be
accepted with all becoming form and gratitude:  so Mr. Dawson's sharp
glances over his spectacles failed to detect anything but the truest
pleasure, and he went on.

"You'll find it very dull, I dare say.  Only a few old fogies like
myself, and one or two good sweet young women:  I never know who'll
come.  Margaret is obliged to lie in a darkened room--only half-
lighted I mean,--because her eyes are weak,--oh, it will be very
stupid, I dare say:  don't thank me till you've been once and tried
it, and then if you like it, your best thanks will be to come again
every Monday, from half-past seven to nine, you know.  Good-bye,
good-bye."

Hitherto I had never been out to a party of grown-up people; and no
court ball to a London young lady could seem more redolent of honour
and pleasure than this Monday evening to me.

Dressed out in new stiff book-muslin, made up to my throat,--a frock
which had seemed to me and my sisters the height of earthly grandeur
and finery--Alice, our old nurse, had been making it at home, in
contemplation of the possibility of such an event during my stay in
Edinburgh, but which had then appeared to me a robe too lovely and
angelic to be ever worn short of heaven--I went with Miss Duncan to
Mr. Dawson's at the appointed time.  We entered through one small
lofty room, perhaps I ought to call it an antechamber, for the house
was old-fashioned, and stately and grand, the large square drawing-
room, into the centre of which Mrs. Dawson's sofa was drawn.  Behind
her a little was placed a table with a great cluster candlestick upon
it, bearing seven or eight wax-lights; and that was all the light in
the room, which looked to me very vast and indistinct after our
pinched-up apartment at the Mackenzie's.  Mrs. Dawson must have been
sixty; and yet her face looked very soft and smooth and child-like.
Her hair was quite gray:  it would have looked white but for the
snowiness of her cap, and satin ribbon.  She was wrapped in a kind of
dressing-gown of French grey merino:  the furniture of the room was
deep rose-colour, and white and gold,--the paper which covered the
walls was Indian, beginning low down with a profusion of tropical
leaves and birds and insects, and gradually diminishing in richness
of detail till at the top it ended in the most delicate tendrils and
most filmy insects.

Mr. Dawson had acquired much riches in his profession, and his house
gave one this impression.  In the corners of the rooms were great
jars of Eastern china, filled with flower-leaves and spices; and in
the middle of all this was placed the sofa, which poor Margaret
Dawson passed whole days, and months, and years, without the power of
moving by herself.  By-and-by Mrs. Dawson's maid brought in tea and
macaroons for us, and a little cup of milk and water and a biscuit
for her.  Then the door opened.  We had come very early, and in came
Edinburgh professors, Edinburgh beauties, and celebrities, all on
their way to some other gayer and later party, but coming first to
see Mrs. Dawson, and tell her their bon-mots, or their interests, or
their plans.  By each learned man, by each lovely girl, she was
treated as a dear friend, who knew something more about their own
individual selves, independent of their reputation and general
society-character, than any one else.

It was very brilliant and very dazzling, and gave enough to think
about and wonder about for many days.

Monday after Monday we went, stationary, silent; what could we find
to say to any one but Mrs. Margaret herself?  Winter passed, summer
was coming, still I was ailing, and weary of my life; but still Mr.
Dawson gave hopes of my ultimate recovery.  My father and mother came
and went; but they could not stay long, they had so many claims upon
them.  Mrs. Margaret Dawson had become my dear friend, although,
perhaps, I had never exchanged as many words with her as I had with
Miss Mackenzie, but then with Mrs. Dawson every word was a pearl or a
diamond.

People began to drop off from Edinburgh, only a few were left, and I
am not sure if our Monday evenings were not all the pleasanter.

There was Mr. Sperano, the Italian exile, banished even from France,
where he had long resided, and now teaching Italian with meek
diligence in the northern city; there was Mr. Preston, the
Westmoreland squire, or, as he preferred to be called, statesman,
whose wife had come to Edinburgh for the education of their numerous
family, and who, whenever her husband had come over on one of his
occasional visits, was only too glad to accompany him to Mrs.
Dawson's Monday evenings, he and the invalid lady having been friends
from long ago.  These and ourselves kept steady visitors, and enjoyed
ourselves all the more from having the more of Mrs. Dawson's society.

One evening I had brought the little stool close to her sofa, and was
caressing her thin white hand, when the thought came into my head and
out I spoke it.

"Tell me, dear Mrs. Dawson," said I, "how long you have been in
Edinburgh; you do not speak Scotch, and Mr. Dawson says he is not
Scotch."

"No, I am Lancashire--Liverpool-born," said she, smiling.  "Don't you
hear it in my broad tongue?"

"I hear something different to other people, but I like it because it
is just you; is that Lancashire?"

"I dare say it is; for, though I am sure Lady Ludlow took pains
enough to correct me in my younger days, I never could get rightly
over the accent."

"Lady Ludlow," said I, "what had she to do with you?  I heard you
talking about her to Lady Madeline Stuart the first evening I ever
came here; you and she seemed so fond of Lady Ludlow; who is she?"

"She is dead, my child; dead long ago."

I felt sorry I had spoken about her, Mrs. Dawson looked so grave and
sad.  I suppose she perceived my sorrow, for she went on and said--
"My dear, I like to talk and to think of Lady Ludlow:  she was my
true, kind friend and benefactress for many years; ask me what you
like about her, and do not think you give me pain."

I grew bold at this.

"Will you tell me all about her, then, please, Mrs. Dawson?"

"Nay," said she, smiling, "that would be too long a story.  Here are
Signor Sperano, and Miss Duncan, and Mr. and Mrs. Preston are coming
to-night, Mr. Preston told me; how would they like to hear an old-
world story which, after all, would be no story at all, neither
beginning, nor middle, nor end, only a bundle of recollections?"

"If you speak of me, madame," said Signor Sperano, "I can only say
you do me one great honour by recounting in my presence anything
about any person that has ever interested you."

Miss Duncan tried to say something of the same kind.  In the middle
of her confused speech, Mr. and Mrs. Preston came in.  I sprang up; I
went to meet them.

"Oh," said I, "Mrs. Dawson is just going to tell us all about Lady
Ludlow, and a great deal more, only she is afraid it won't interest
anybody:  do say you would like to hear it!"

Mrs. Dawson smiled at me, and in reply to their urgency she promised
to tell us all about Lady Ludlow, on condition that each one of us
should, after she had ended, narrate something interesting, which we
had either heard, or which had fallen within our own experience.  We
all promised willingly, and then gathered round her sofa to hear what
she could tell us about my Lady Ludlow.

[At this point comes "My Lady Ludlow"--already released by Project
Gutenberg]

As any one may guess, it had taken Mrs. Dawson several Monday
evenings to narrate all this history of the days of her youth.  Miss
Duncan thought it would be a good exercise for me, both in memory and
composition, to write out on Tuesday mornings all that I had heard
the night before; and thus it came to pass that I have the manuscript
of "My Lady Ludlow" now lying by me.


Mr. Dawson had often come in and out of the room during the time that
his sister had been telling us about Lady Ludlow.  He would stop, and
listen a little, and smile or sigh as the case might be.  The Monday
after the dear old lady had wound up her tale (if tale it could be
called), we felt rather at a loss what to talk about, we had grown so
accustomed to listen to Mrs. Dawson.  I remember I was saying, "Oh,
dear!  I wish some one would tell us another story!" when her brother
said, as if in answer to my speech, that he had drawn up a paper all
ready for the Philosophical Society, and that perhaps we might care
to hear it before it was sent off:  it was in a great measure
compiled from a French book, published by one of the Academies, and
rather dry in itself; but to which Mr. Dawson's attention had been
directed, after a tour he had made in England during the past year,
in which he had noticed small walled-up doors in unusual parts of
some old parish churches, and had been told that they had formerly
been appropriated to the use of some half-heathen race, who, before
the days of gipsies, held the same outcast pariah position in most of
the countries of western Europe.  Mr. Dawson had been recommended to
the French book which he named, as containing the fullest and most
authentic account of this mysterious race, the Cagots.  I did not
think I should like hearing this paper as much as a story; but, of
course, as he meant it kindly, we were bound to submit, and I found
it, on the whole, more interesting than I anticipated.

[At this point comes "An Accursed Race"--already released by Project
Gutenberg]

For some time past I had observed that Miss Duncan made a good deal
of occupation for herself in writing, but that she did not like me to
notice her employment.  Of course this made me all the more curious;
and many were my silent conjectures--some of them so near the truth
that I was not much surprised when, after Mr. Dawson had finished
reading his Paper to us, she hesitated, coughed, and abruptly
introduced a little formal speech, to the effect that she had noted
down an old Welsh story the particulars of which had often been told
her in her youth, as she lived close to the place where the events
occurred.  Everybody pressed her to read the manuscript, which she
now produced from her reticule; but, when on the point of beginning,
her nervousness seemed to overcome her, and she made so many
apologies for its being the first and only attempt she had ever made
at that kind of composition, that I began to wonder if we should ever
arrive at the story at all.  At length, in a high-pitched, ill-
assured voice, she read out the title:

"THE DOOM OF THE GRIFFITHS."

[At this point comes "The Doom of the Griffiths"--already released by
Project Gutenberg]

You cannot think how kindly Mrs. Dawson thanked Miss Duncan for
writing and reading this story.  She shook my poor, pale governess so
tenderly by the hand that the tears came into her eyes, and the
colour to her checks.

"I though you had been so kind; I liked hearing about Lady Ludlow; I
fancied, perhaps, I could do something to give a little pleasure,"
were the half-finished sentences Miss Duncan stammered out.  I am
sure it was the wish to earn similar kind words from Mrs. Dawson,
that made Mrs. Preston try and rummage through her memory to see if
she could not recollect some fact, or event, or history, which might
interested Mrs. Dawson and the little party that gathered round her
sofa.  Mrs. Preston it was who told us the following tale:

"HALF A LIFE-TIME AGO."

[At this point comes "Half a Life-Time Ago"--already released by

When this narrative was finished, Mrs. Dawson called on our two
gentlemen, Signor Sperano and Mr. Preston, and told them that they
had hitherto been amused or interested, but that it was now their
turn to amuse or interest.  They looked at each other as if this
application of hers took them by surprise, and seemed altogether as
much abashed as well-grown men can ever be.  Signor Sperano was the
first to recover himself:  after thinking a little, he said -

"Your will, dear lady, is law.  Next Monday evening, I will bring you
an old, old story, which I found among the papers of the good old
priest who first welcomed me to England.  It was but a poor return
for his generous kindness; but I had the opportunity of nursing him
through the cholera, of which he died.  He left me all that he had--
no money--but his scanty furniture, his book of prayers, his crucifix
and rosary, and his papers.  How some of those papers came into his
hands I know not.  They had evidently been written many years before
the venerable man was born; and I doubt whether he had ever examined
the bundles, which had come down to him from some old ancestor, or in
some strange bequest.  His life was too busy to leave any time for
the gratification of mere curiosity; I, alas! have only had too much
leisure."

Next Monday, Signor Sperano read to us the story which I will call

"THE POOR CLARE."

Now, of all our party who had first listened to my Lady Ludlow, Mr.
Preston was the only one who had not told us something, either of
information, tradition, history, or legend.  We naturally turned to
him; but we did not like asking him directly for his contribution,
for he was a grave, reserved, and silent man.

He understood us, however, and, rousing himself as it were, he said -

"I know you wish me to tell you, in my turn, of something which I
have learnt during my life.  I could tell you something of my own
life, and of a life dearer still to my memory; but I have shunk from
narrating anything so purely personal.  Yet, shrink as I will, no
other but those sad recollections will present themselves to my mind.
I call them sad when I think of the end of it all.  However, I am not
going to moralize.  If my dear brother's life and death does not
speak for itself, no words of mine will teach you what may be learnt
from it."
